# Devloper's notes

## Next order of business:

* Fix the formatting in the text content (padding and font sizes) 

* create clear documentation

* Webflow integration guide

* a clear README file

* Add pop up windows - documentation and chip sections



## complete


* deploy on vercel free tier (the project is already on github, I already used vercel before and have an account)

* adjust the menu width to be around 25% of the screen instead of a third

* make it mobile friendly (at least in landscape mode) - we need all the text to be a bit smaller, and we need the menu items to be a lot less spaced on mobile. I've attached a screen shot of the iphone 14 pro max setting in chrome's 'inspect' mode. the menu, home and sound buttons at the buttom left are currently overlapping the content. we should make these buttons smaller in both desktop and mobile.

* sound effect to button click  assets\sound\KEDR Audio - Computer Sounds - Interface Squeak Blip Button Choosing Electronic.wav
